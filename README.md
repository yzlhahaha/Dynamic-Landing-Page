## style.css
The style.css file is barely modified from the original version. All 'your-active-class' are switched to 'active'.
## app.js
The app.js file is where most changes were made. With app.js, the landing page changes from a static website to a dynamic website. The navigation bar and the background circles will automatically updated as the content of the website becomes more (in this case, as the number of sections goes up).
## index.html
The index.html file is barely modified from the original version. The only change is that the classname for the first section is changed from 'your-active-class' to 'active'.
## launch
In order to launch, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file.
